<h2>What is an objdir?</h2>
<p>An objdir build refers to the process of creating the output files in a different place than where the source lives. This is a standard feature of most configure-based projects. It allows you to build for multiple configurations, including multiple platforms if you use a network filesystem, from a single source tree. It also avoids tainting your source tree so that you know that the files in your tree have not been modified by the build process.
</p>
<p>
If you run configure by hand, you can use the standard method of creating an empty directory any place on the disk, changing to that directory and running /path/to/mozilla/configure from there.
</p>
<pre>
    mkdir obj-debug
    cd obj-debug
    ../mozilla/configure
</pre>
<p>If you use client.mk to build, you can add the following to your mozconfig file:
</p>
<pre>
    mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=/path/to/objdir
</pre>
